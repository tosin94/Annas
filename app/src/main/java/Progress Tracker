#### 18th Sept - 25 sept 2017 OBJECTIVES ####

*   Make a gallery for order food. Layout will be like that of just-eat. (possibly be using recycler view as there might be a lot of info to display)
*   ADD another Gallery for the hair stylists ( most likely a listview for this)
*   Add a toast message for when the user adds to the basket
*   Check which areas of the app will be using recycler view and start implementing
*   Research Adequate Database to use (Azure or SQL developer. could also use sql developer for a more visual view of the database
*   Add a logger in error prone and critical areas of the app. (log file will be maintained by a script which will clear file contents periodically)
*   Have a look at implementing Services and Content providers
*   Main page will now be a login screen (Main Activity will now be the login screen) and the old main activity will be page it transitions to when login is successful - sort out later

###############

*   tip from Ramnick -> use an android sqlite database and a server (so local and external server but less expensive network tranactions). they will both be in sync and there will not need to be any expensive trasnfer of information such as images itself. instead
the transfer of info could just be things like ID and unique info that can help identify more information
